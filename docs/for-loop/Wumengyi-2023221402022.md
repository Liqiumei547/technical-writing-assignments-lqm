
# Introduction

The for loop is a commonly used control structure that allows a program to execute a block of code repeatedly for a specified number of times. It is often used to iterate over arrays or collections.

## Syntax

The basic syntax of a for loop is as follows:

```python
for variable in iterable:
     # Code block to execute
```

variable is the current value in each iteration of the loop.
iterable is an object that can be iterated over, such as a list, tuple, or string.

## Example： print numbers from 1 to 5

for i in range(5):
    print(i)
End

Output：
0
1
2
3
4

## Conclusion

The for loop is a powerful and flexible tool that can effectively simplify repetitive tasks.
