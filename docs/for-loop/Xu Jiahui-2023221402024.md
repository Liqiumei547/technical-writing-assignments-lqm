# Beginner's Tutorial on For Loops

## Introduction

Welcome to our beginner's tutorial on for loops in Python. For loops are very important in programming. They let you run a block of code many times, based on a sequence. This tutorial will give you a strong understanding of for loops. It will cover their structure, common uses, and key ideas you need to know.

## Prerequisites

Before you start learning about for loops, it's important to know the basics of:

Variables and data types

Functions and basic syntax

Print statements

## What is a For Loop?

A for loop controls the flow of a program. It lets you move through a sequence, such as a list, tuple, string, or range. For each item in the sequence, the for loop runs a block of code.

## Syntax

Here's the basic syntax for a for loop in Python:

```python
for item in sequence:  
    # Block of code to execute for each item  
    print(item)
```

### Example 1: Iterating Over a List

```php
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  
  
for fruit in fruits:  
    print(fruit)
```

Output:

apple  
banana  
cherry

In this example, the for loop iterates over each item in the fruits list, and the print statement prints each fruit.

### Example 2: Iterating Over a Range

The range() function in Python generates a sequence of numbers. You can use it with for loops to execute a block of code a specific number of times.

```python
for i in range(5):  
    print(i)
```

Output:

0  
1  
2  
3  
4

In this example, the range(5) generates numbers from 0 to 4, and the for loop prints each number.

### Example 3: Iterating Over a String

You can also use for loops to iterate over strings.

```python
greeting = "Hello, World!"  
  
for char in greeting:  
    print(char)

```

Output:

H  
e  
l  
l  
o  
,  

W  
o  
r  
l  
d  
!

In this example, the for loop iterates over each character in the greeting string, and the print statement prints each character.

## Nested For Loops

You can nest for loops inside each other to create more complex iterations.

```python
for i in range(3):  
    for j in range(2):  
        print(f"i = {i}, j = {j}")

```

Output:

i = 0, j = 0  
i = 0, j = 1  
i = 1, j = 0  
i = 1, j = 1  
i = 2, j = 0  
i = 2, j = 1

In this example, the outer loop runs 3 times, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs 2 times.

## Breaking and Continuing the Loop

You can use the break and continue statements to control the flow of the loop.

break: Terminates the loop and exits.  
continue: Skips the current iteration and moves to the next.

### Using break  

```python
for i in range(10):  
    if i == 5:  
        break  
    print(i)  
```
  
Output: 0 1 2 3 4  
  
### Using continue  

```python
for i in range(10):  
    if i % 2 == 0:  
        continue  
    print(i)  
```
  
Output: 1 3 5 7 9

## Enumerate Function

The enumerate() function is useful when you need both the index and the value while iterating over a sequence.

fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']  
  
```python
for index, fruit in enumerate(fruits):  
    print(f"Index: {index}, Fruit: {fruit}")
```

Output:  
Index: 0, Fruit: apple  
Index: 1, Fruit: banana  
Index: 2, Fruit: cherry

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You have finished the beginner's tutorial on for loops in Python. For loops are a strong tool for going through sequences and doing tasks repeatedly. Keep practicing with various examples and look into more complex uses as you keep learning Python.
